<p class="spider">Spiders (order <i>Araneae</i>) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs and chelicerae with fangs that inject venom. They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all other orders of organisms. Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every habitat with the exceptions of air and sea colonization. In November 2015, at least 45,700 spider species, and 113 families have been recorded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)"><ins class="sp1">taxonomists</ins></a>. However, there has been dissension within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified, as evidenced by the over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900.</p>

<!-- For some paragraphs I decided to customize it in on the css sheet  -->
<p>The Goliath birdeater (Theraphosa blondi) belongs to the <i>tarantula</i> family <i>Theraphosidae</i>. Found in northern South America, it is the largest spider in the world by mass and size, but it is second to the giant huntsman spider by leg-span. It is also called the <mark>Goliath bird-eating spider</mark>. Its name "bird-eating" derives from an early 18th-century copper engraving by <ins><em>Maria Sibylla Merian</em></ins> that shows one eating a hummingbird. It only rarely preys on birds.</p>

<p>The spider species <i>Argiope aurantia</i> is commonly known as the <mark>yellow garden spider</mark>, <mark>black and yellow garden spider</mark>, <mark>golden garden spider</mark>, <mark>writing spider</mark>, <mark>corn spider</mark>, or <mark>McKinley spider</mark>. It is common to the contiguous United States, Hawaii, southern Canada, Mexico, and Central America. It has distinctive yellow and black markings on the abdomen and a mostly white cephalothorax. Its scientific Latin name translates to <em>"gilded silver-face" (the genus name Argiope meaning "silver-face", while the specific epithet aurantia means "gilded")</em>. Males range from 5–9 mm (0.20–0.35 in); females range from 19–28 mm (0.75–1.10 in). These spiders may bite if disturbed or harassed, but the venom is seemingly harmless to humans.</p>

<p>The giant huntsman spider <em>(Heteropoda maxima, "the largest")</em> is a species of huntsman spider <em>(Sparassidae)</em>, a family of large, fast spiders that actively hunt down prey. It is considered the world's largest spider by leg span, which can reach up to 1 foot (30 centimeters).</p>

</a>

<p>Wolf spiders are members of the family <i>Lycosidae</i>, from the Ancient Greek word <em>"λύκος"</em> meaning "wolf". They are robust and agile hunters with excellent eyesight. They live mostly in solitude and hunt alone, and do not spin webs. Some are opportunistic hunters pouncing upon prey as they find it or even chasing it over short distances. Some will wait for passing prey in or near the mouth of a burrow.

Wolf spiders resemble nursery web spiders (family <em>Pisauridae</em>), but wolf spiders carry their egg sacs by attaching them to their spinnerets. (<em>Pisauridae</em> carry their egg sacs with their chelicerae and pedipalps). Two of the wolf spider's eight eyes are large and prominent, which distinguishes them from the nursery web spiders whose eyes are all of approximately equal size. This can also help distinguish them from <b>grass spiders</b>.
